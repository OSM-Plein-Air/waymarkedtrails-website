osmc_symbol:
  background: The background works in a similar way. It also consists of a colour
    and a shape. The background may also be only a colour name which results in a
    canvas of the chosen colour. This is shown in the first row.
  foreground: The foreground symbol consists of a colour and a shape linked by an
    underscore. The table below shows all combinations recognised by this site. It
    also recognises foregrounds that consist only of the name of the shape. The symbols
    for those are shown in the last column.
